Listen to the audio and transcribe it accurately. The user is capturing thoughts, tasks, or ideas for a productivity system.

After transcription, analyze the content and extract:
1. Any actionable tasks (things that can be done)
2. Any thoughts or ideas (reference material, things to remember)

Return a JSON object:

    {
      "rawInput": "portion of transcript that is a task",
      "nextAction": "clear action starting with a verb"
    }
  ],
  "thoughts": [
    {
      "content": "portion that is a thought/idea",
      "suggestedTags": ["relevant", "tags"]
